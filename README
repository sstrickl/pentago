# This is a game of pentago that can be played completely from the terminal.
# play the game by loading the pentago file then by creating a new instance of
# Pentago aka game = Pentago.new
# begin with game.place(1,2) - or whichever coordinates you would like. 
# you will then be prompted to turn a board, to do so use game.turn_board_A (B, C, or D)
# player 2 then can place in the same way and so on, until there is a winner.
# player 1's moves will be indicated with a 1 and 2's with a 2. 

There are still several issues with my code which I would like to straighten out. 

For more information about how to play the game see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago.

The methods are: 

printBoards - prints the 4 boards 

playerTurn - sets the player turn to 1 or 2

place - set a 'marble' in any coordinate 0,0 - 5,5 marked with u.

*I would like to combine the following methods into 1*

turn_board_A(direction) - turn board A "left" or "right"

turn_board_B(direction) - turn board B "left" or "right"

turn_board_C(direction) - turn board C "left" or "right"

turn_board_D(direction) - turn board D "left" or "right"

win - goes through all the possibilities of a win
