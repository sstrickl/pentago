# This is a game of pentago that can be played completely from the terminal.
# play the game by loading the pentago file then by creating a new instance of
# Pentago aka game = Pentago.new
# begin with game.place_marble(1,2) - or whichever coordinates you would like. 

There are still several issues with my code which I will straighten out and refactor. For
example, in future versions I would like to have a game engine. There are also a couple more win
scenarios.

It's very exciting putting this game together because I was able to utilize a matrix. I love the 
challenge of writing this and I hope people can someday enjoy playing it. 

For more information about how to play the game see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago.

The methods are: 

print_board - prints the 4 boards 

get_player_turn - returns which player's turn it is

place_marble - current player places a marble

turn_board - turns a board either left or right

turn_board_helper - turns a 3x3 submatrix

win - goes through all the possibilities of a win to return a winner

get_winner - returns draw, none or a winner
