This is a game of pentago that can be played completely from the terminal. It's a good start,
but there is way too much repetition so I need to fix that. 

For more information about how to play the game see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago.

The methods are: 

printBoards - prints the 4 boards 

playerTurn - sets the player turn to 1 or 2

place - set a 'marble' in any coordinate 0,0 - 5,5 marked with u.

*I would like to combine the following methods into 1*
turn_board_A(direction) - turn board A left or right

turn_board_B(direction) - turn board B left or right

turn_board_C(direction) - turn board C left or right

turn_board_D(direction) - turn board D left or right 
*****************************************************

*I would also like to combine these methods into 1 or 2*
winDiag5 - checks to see if there is a win starting in the upper right corner 
winDiag4 - checks to see if there is a win starting in the upper right corner -1
winDiag1 - checks to see if there is a win starting in the upper left corner -1
winDiag0 - checks to see if there is a win starting in the upper left corner 

check to see if there is a win in any rows: 
winRow0
winRow1

check to see if there is a win in any columns:
winCol0
winCol1
