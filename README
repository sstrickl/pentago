# This is a game of pentago that can be played completely from the terminal.

There are still a couple of issues with the code which I would like to straighten out. There are a couple
more win scenarios to take into account. I would also like to make the win function more concise and elegant. 

It's very exciting putting this game together because I was able to utilize a matrix and learn about modularity. 
I love the challenge of writing this and I hope people can someday enjoy playing it. 

For more information about how to play the game see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago.

The methods are: 

print_board - prints the 4 boards 

get_player_turn - returns which player's turn it is

place_marble - current player places a marble

turn_board - turns a board either left or right

turn_board_helper - turns a 3x3 submatrix

win - goes through all the possibilities of a win to return a winner

get_winner - returns draw, none or a winner
